# Cloud foundation and delivery

This document covers TOS-2: repository layout, checks, environment configuration and the development/production delivery workflows. All commands run in cloud agent workspaces or GitHub Actions. Nothing here requires the owner's machine.

**Authentication is not implemented.** `/api/v1/health` is the only working API route. `/api/mcp` fails closed with `503` for every request. TOS-3 delivers Supabase-managed authentication, tenant schema and RLS.

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Next.js App Router: admin UI pages and thin route handlers |
| `src/app/api/v1/` | Versioned HTTP API routes; delegate to `src/adapters/http` |
| `src/app/api/mcp/` | MCP endpoint; delegates to `src/adapters/mcp` |
| `src/adapters/http/` | HTTP translation (JSON and RFC 9457 problem responses) |
| `src/adapters/mcp/` | MCP translation; disabled until TOS-3 |
| `src/server/application/` | Shared use cases called by every client (UI, API, MCP) |
| `src/server/domain/` | Pure business rules; no framework, I/O or adapter imports |
| `src/server/query/` | Allowlisted semantic queries and report definitions; never arbitrary SQL |
| `src/server/config/` | Reviewed environment bindings and runtime configuration validation |
| `scripts/` | Repository hygiene scan, deployment binding check, smoke test |
| `tests/` | Vitest suites (synthetic values only) |

ESLint and `tests/architecture.test.ts` enforce the dependency direction: `app → adapters → application → domain/query/config`. Server layers cannot import Next.js, React or adapters.

## Checks

`pnpm check` runs the same gates as CI except the audit:

| Command | Gate |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm format:check` | Prettier |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint (zero warnings), including layer boundaries |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` (strict) |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest |
| `pnpm hygiene` | Rejects tracked/untracked private files, credentials and real data |
| `pnpm build` | Production `next build` |
| `pnpm hygiene --artifact .next` | Secret scan of the build output |
| `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` | Production dependency audit |

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these on every pull request with a read-only token and no secrets. The deployment workflows call it before deploying.

## Runtime environment variables

Set these on each **Vercel project** under *Settings → Environment Variables*, environment **Production** (both projects deploy their main target; see below). Never put them in the repository. `.env.example` lists the names with placeholders only.

| Variable | `tutor-mbos-dev` | `tutor-mbos` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TUTOR_MBOS_ENV` | `development` | `production` | Required |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://idvzjqrkgnihvxoswuxu.supabase.co` | `https://vblwjqfpcmegbugmufif.supabase.co` | Required; must match `TUTOR_MBOS_ENV` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `sb_publishable_<dev placeholder>` | `sb_publishable_<prod placeholder>` | Optional until TOS-3; publishable key from Supabase *Project Settings → API Keys* |

Rules enforced by `src/server/config/environments.ts` and the deployment workflows:

- A development deployment must point at the development Supabase project, and production at production. Swapped values fail the health check and block the deployment.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are shipped to browsers. Secret keys (`sb_secret_…`), service-role JWTs and other credentials are rejected there.
- No Supabase secret key or service-role key is used by this increment. Do not add one to either Vercel project.

`TUTOR_MBOS_BUILD_COMMIT` is set by the workflows at build time so the health endpoint reports the deployed commit. It is not configured anywhere else.

## Secure configuration locations

| Where | What | Who sets it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel project `tutor-mbos-dev` → Environment Variables (Production) | Runtime variables above, development values | Owner or Codex |
| Vercel project `tutor-mbos` → Environment Variables (Production) | Runtime variables above, production values | Owner or Codex, at release time |
| GitHub → Settings → Environments → `development` → Secrets | `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Owner or Codex |
| GitHub → Settings → Environments → `production` → Secrets | `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Owner or Codex, at release time |
| GitHub environment secrets (optional) | `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` | Only if Vercel Deployment Protection blocks the smoke test |
| GitHub environment variables (optional) | `SMOKE_BASE_URL` | Only to smoke test a stable alias instead of the deployment URL |
| GitHub → Settings → Environments → `production` → Variables | `PRODUCTION_RELEASES_ENABLED=true` | Owner, only after final sign-off |

Agent workspaces, pull request workflows and the repository never hold these values.

`VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` is Vercel's *Protection Bypass for Automation* value (Vercel project → Settings → Deployment Protection). It only lets the smoke test reach a protected deployment. It is not an application token and grants no API or MCP access.

## One-time platform setup

The Vercel projects and Supabase projects already exist. Do not recreate them.

1. **Vercel token.** Create a token scoped to team `lets-play-game` (`team_2QehRm248FPmHJTzKS0rvS6b`) at Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens. Prefer separate tokens for the `development` and `production` GitHub environments so either can be revoked alone. Vercel tokens are team-scoped, not project-scoped; the workflows pin the project IDs and verify the linked project before deploying.
2. **GitHub environment `development`.** Create it at GitHub → Settings → Environments. Restrict deployment branches to `main`. Add secret `VERCEL_TOKEN`.
3. **GitHub environment `production`.** Create it. Restrict deployment branches to `main`. Add required reviewers (the owner) and enable *Prevent self-review*. Add secret `VERCEL_TOKEN`. Do not add `PRODUCTION_RELEASES_ENABLED` until final sign-off.
4. **Vercel runtime variables.** Add the variables in the table above to each project's Production environment.
5. **Vercel project settings.** For both projects: Framework Preset *Next.js*, Node.js version *24.x*. A Git connection is optional; `vercel.json` disables Git-triggered deployments so only the workflows deploy.
6. **Deployment Protection (development).** If enabled, either generate a *Protection Bypass for Automation* secret and store it as `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` in the `development` GitHub environment, or set `SMOKE_BASE_URL` to an unprotected alias.

## Development deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-development.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on manual dispatch from `main`:

1. Reusable CI (all checks above).
2. `vercel pull` for project `prj_ysIJHdIKYk2MQwvOKermUvIMuGVa`.
3. `scripts/assert-deploy-target.ts development`: linked team/project and pulled runtime variables must match the development binding.
4. `vercel build --prod` in CI, then a secret scan of `.vercel/output`.
5. `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod` to `tutor-mbos-dev`. Development uses that project's main target because the project only ever holds synthetic data.
6. `scripts/smoke-health.ts`: `/api/v1/health` must return `200`, `environment: development`, the development Supabase project ref and the deployed commit.

To trigger manually: GitHub → Actions → *Deploy development* → *Run workflow* on `main`.

## Production release

`.github/workflows/release-production.yml` never runs on push. It requires all of:

1. Manual dispatch from `main` with `candidate_sha` (full 40-character SHA).
2. The candidate is on `main` and has a successful *Deploy development* run.
3. Reusable CI passes for the candidate.
4. Approval on the protected `production` GitHub environment.
5. `PRODUCTION_RELEASES_ENABLED=true` on that environment.
6. Linked project is `tutor-mbos` (`prj_Ibov9zZm4KOvga3pWUQ83pInPJfQ`) and runtime variables match the production binding.
7. Artifact secret scan, prebuilt deploy, then smoke test expecting `environment: production`.

The initial production release waits for final sign-off (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Cloud agent setup

Agents (Cursor, Devin) need no secrets for this repository:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.34.6 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

Node.js 24 (`.nvmrc`) is required; `engine-strict` rejects other versions. To run the app in a workspace, use synthetic configuration that matches a binding, for example:

```bash
TUTOR_MBOS_ENV=development \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://idvzjqrkgnihvxoswuxu.supabase.co \
pnpm dev
```

Do not run `vercel link`, `vercel env pull` or deployments from agent workspaces. Deployment credentials live only in the GitHub environments.

## What is excluded from Git and deployments

`.gitignore`, `.vercelignore` and `scripts/check-repo-hygiene.ts` exclude or reject: `.env*` files except `.env.example`, `.vercel/` state, key and certificate files, `private/`, `data/`, `exports/` directories, database files and dumps, spreadsheets outside synthetic fixtures, logs, and content resembling private keys, Supabase secret keys, GitHub tokens, database URLs with passwords and JWTs. CI and the deployment workflows run the scan before any artifact is uploaded.
